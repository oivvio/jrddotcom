<SPAN >Interview by Fredrik Str&#246;mberg.
<BR>
Published in the Swedish periodical Bild &amp; Bubbla 2001
(Picture&amp;Bubble)</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf"><BIG CLASS="XXLARGE">Love and Career - a chat with JRD</BIG></SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">She came from nowhere, or so it seemed, and she created one 
of the 90's biggest graphic novel successes; Miss Scardy 
Cat &amp; Love. She came from another direction than most 
createurs, and therefore she chose a new form and a new kind 
of storytelling. The result didn't fail her. The book stayed 
on the booksellers' top-ten lists for an eternity and reached 
a lot of people who wouldn't ordinarily read this genre. The 
follow-up Miss Remarkable and her Career has 
arrived and Bild&amp;Bubbla has knocked on Joannas 
door for an audience with the Swedish graphic novel's uncrowned 
queen.</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-When was the idea to Miss Scardy-Cat born?</SPAN>

<P>
-The plot in Miss Scardy-Cat &amp; Love was actually 
born more than five years before the book was published. After 
I had quit Konstfack (School of Fine Arts) I felt a deep urge 
to write. I bought a lap-top and for a couple of months I tried 
to find a direction and a language for my writing. On the one 
hand I remember this period as if driven by an extraordinary 
force, a kind of creative electricity, on the other hand I had 
the feeling that the whole idea of me writing was totally insane.
<BR>
I had no experience of writing whatsoever. There are so many 
people dreaming about becoming writers and I hadn't even done 
any writing for my closet. And my writing didn't really come 
out very well. I couldn't make it work. When I got a summer job 
for the tabloid Expressen, I felt a kind of relief, 
since I let myself off the hook. The job at Expressen 
turned out to be a surprisingly useful experience. I stayed there 
for almost a year.
<BR>
Even when I became a full-time freelance illustrator the dream 
and the urge to write was still there. I hate clich&#233;s about 
artistry but I actually do think that my writing, or rather my 
storytelling, was more of a necessity than a choice.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Okay. But how come you chose the form of the graphic novel, 
to tell your story?</SPAN>

<P>
-I had still kept the dream to write this novel in the back of 
my head. One morning when I was on my way to my studio, I suddenly 
got the idea that I could draw the novel instead of writing it. 
What I saw before me in that moment was a kind of translation 
of prose into pictures. I really thought it a brilliant idea, 
since it seemed totally original and new to me. I went to my 
studio and started working with it right away and I immediately 
felt that it could work. It was so inspiring! Later I learned 
that the genre graphic novel is well-known in 
the USA, and that Will Eisner coined it in the seventies. So, 
the phrase graphic novel wasn't new at all, as 
I had believed. But that wasn't important, the important thing 
was that I had found a language, a form, that suited me so well. 
However, I do think that my books created <SPAN  CLASS="textit">something</SPAN> new, 
even if this new thing about them was only to evolve a small 
part of an already existing form.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Yes, when I read your first book, I immediately felt that 
you managed to create something unique, and I have read quite 
a lot over the years. But this issue regarding the graphic 
novel; when you created Miss Scardy-Cat 
weren't you aware of the longer, more serious graphic novels 
that had already been published during the last two decades?</SPAN>

<P>
-No, I wasn't. On the cover of Miss Scardy-Cat &amp; Love 
I wrote  A graphic novel, as a kind of description 
of the form. I chose to subtitle the book in this way since my 
primus motor was the very idea of translating a novel into pictures 
- to do a graphic novel. Nevertheless, I still 
think it a good description since the term isn't loaded 
in the way the word cartoon or comics 
is, at least not here in Sweden.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-No, that is probably true. You also chose a rather odd format 
for your book; square, with one picture on each page. It felt 
like a fresh breeze, as I see so many createurs working in the 
same format as everybody else, without even questioning it. How 
did you come up with that idea?</SPAN>

<P>
-I think that all pictures become a lot better - more interesting 
- when they are given more space. Pictures that are blown up 
over a whole newspaper page become very effective. Hence, the 
exact same picture can be totally harmless and uninteresting 
when its scaled down to a small size. That is why the H&amp;Ms lingerie 
ads are as horrible as they are effective.  
<BR>
Using one picture on each page in my books, gives the pictures 
a fair chance to play an important role in the story, they are 
given their own value. But this isn't anything that makes me 
unique. Both Tove Jansson and Anna H&#246;glund have been doing 
picture-books for adults inspired by children's books' format 
- one picture per page. Anna H&#246;glund's Cyborgs' Curse 
(Syborgs f&#246;rbannelse) has been a very important 
book for me and Tove Jansson is an easy-to-read role model for 
my books, especially thematically and psychologically. Her stories 
revolve around wide spaces of darkness and dangers 
but they always have a safety anchor to supply hope. But to get 
back to your question; what I regard as new with my books is 
that I use this format in combination with the length of the 
stories. That creates a slower tempo, which suits me well.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Yes, I can imagine that. What has the form meant for your 
storytelling?</SPAN>

<P>
-Text and pictures in symbiosis feel like my backyard 
now, which I am very grateful to have found. There was a time 
when I didn't have a clue what to do with my disparate wishes 
- on the one hand to write - on the other to draw. Hopefully, 
I can evolve from this backyard and find new adventures. Work 
with other forms of storytelling in the future. That is something 
I am really keen on.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Somewhere you've said that you don't like the ordinary format 
of graphic novels, and comic books, with a lot of pictures on 
the same page, since you can't avoid looking ahead.</SPAN>

<P>
-Yes, that is true, but I want to take the opportunity to point 
out that I really do like to read a lot of mainstream comics 
too, but that I wouldn't like to work that way myself. When I 
was in my country house the other day I read all my old Tintin-albums, 
and yes, I couldn't help glancing ahead...

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-I have to admit that after reading Miss Scardy Cat 
and after noticing how successful it became I thought that other 
Swedish createurs would use your format and that we would be 
able to enjoy a whole bunch of Swedish graphic novels, 
but there hasn't even been one. Why do you think that is?</SPAN>

<P>
-No idea. But it is a time-consuming format to work with, so 
maybe they just haven't been ready to publish anything yet. The 
other day I saw an ad for a Children's Books competition where 
they wanted a manuscript that could be in the form of a comic 
as well. That's great. I haven't seen that before.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Is there anyone in particular that you would like to see 
create a graphic novel?</SPAN>

<P>
-...Eh...no. I have never even thought of that. There are people 
whom I admire for their way of telling a story, though. One of 
those are Pytte Ravn who makes the Children's TV show Anki 
at SvT. She is extraordinary when it comes to storytelling.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Let's talk about storytelling, how do you work when you 
create these long stories? Do you write manuscripts first, do 
you plan the lengths of the stories, do you sketch a lot or do 
you just work from the first page to the end of the book?</SPAN>

<P>
-When I started to work with Miss Scardy-Cat 
I had my unfinished novel, the one I had written years earlier, 
to work from. Therefore I had a rather strong idea of how the 
story would evolve, even if that sounds a lot more structured 
and easy than it really was. The work with Miss Remarkable 
&amp; her Career was almost absurd in its complexity. I 
didn't have any story at all; I hadn't even a thread to follow. 
I only had the subject; work, performance-anxiety, human value. 
I just started, did sketches and made a lot of notes of thoughts 
that I had about these issues. I collected everything I could 
think of that related to it; newspaper articles, quotations from 
books, radio and television. I wrote down stories that people 
told me and I did many more or less independent scenes for the 
book. During one period of time I had more than 800 pages in 
my Miss Remarkable-portfolio on my computer. 
At times it was really chaotic. The story came together very 
late in the process.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-A really exciting way of working and probably rather unusual 
in this field. The American James Kochalka, whom I interviewed 
in the first issue, has a similar way of working. If you think 
about it, the themes you bring up in you books aren't easy. Both 
books feel like a kind of developing novels in which the main 
character goes through a series of problems which form the individual 
and her identity. Is that a kind of basic idea in your books?</SPAN>

<P>
-I've always liked books that give the reader some kind of hope, 
a reconciliation. I don't mind darkness, anxiety and irony, but 
I want something else too. It's a difficult balance. When I tried 
to write my novel, I think one of my main problems was that I 
didn't have any solutions to the issues I wrote about. I think 
that had to do with my lack of trust.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-You seem to have an ambivalent attitude towards love. I 
can, even as a man, with no doubt, recognize myself in the feelings 
that your main-character goes through in your first book. Have 
you noticed any differences in the reaction of male or female 
readers?</SPAN>

<P>
-By the reactions on Miss Scardy-Cat I understood 
that some female readers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">think</SPAN> that men don't have these 
kind of feelings. As if females would have some sort of patent 
on feelings of insecurity, fear, loneliness, crushes and love, 
well, I guess all feelings. If that were true it would be very 
sad. Luckily I didn't get that impression by the reactions of 
the male readers - on the contrary, they seemed to identify with 
Miss Scardy-Cat in a rather unproblematic way. Maybe without 
regarding her sex as an obstacle to the same degree.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-That's how it was for me, no doubt. OK, and now over to 
the obligatory question; you've said in an interview that your 
books are, one third autobiographical, one third inspired by 
things you've read or heard and one third made up. Is that so, 
and if it is, how did you use your own experiences in your books?</SPAN>

<P>
-Yes, I do think that's a possible answer. When one talks about 
autobiographies one should keep in mind that the word autobiography 
is a kind of promise. A promise that you actually are telling 
the truth. The truth about yourself and your own and other people's 
lives. As if you are telling it exactly as it really was, or 
is. I don't have that ambition, actually it doesn't interest 
me at all. What does interest me is to try to capture the diffuse 
and unclear pictures of what's going on inside and around us 
all, and to try to make new pictures that make it clear and comprehensible. 
I exaggerate, if not only to show a point. I do hope that that 
is what I do, I mean that I succeed in that ambition. I use this 
almost surreal subjective perspective because the caricature 
makes some things clearer. The main characters are the only ones 
in the books whom it is possible to identify with, they are the 
ones who feel like a three-dimensional person. The other ones 
are as flat as paper-dolls. Clich&#233;s. It can feel that way to 
exist. I don't mean that's how it is, I only mean that one <SPAN  CLASS="textit">can</SPAN> 
feel that way.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Your publisher chose to not mention the word comics 
in the publicity of your books, but you don't seem to be afraid 
of the fact that you are a part of the comics media. How do you 
regard your own work, is it comics or not?</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  >-Oops. It wasn't ever about what Bonnier Publishers or I 
chose to say, or not say. I do regard my books as a cross between 
comics, children's books for adults and novels. Therefore, I 
also regard the term graphic novel as a good 
description, even though I know that it was an eyesore for some 
people in the comics media in Sweden. As I look at it, I wasn't 
distancing myself <i>from</i>  the comics as much as I was attempting 
to explain an affiliation <i>with something else</i>.</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-I guess I have to admit that I was one of those who didn't 
like the term. A graphic short story could perhaps 
have been more suitable. But since I really liked the book that 
wasn't a big issue. By the way, do you read comics yourself?</SPAN>

<P>
-I like to read mainstream comics like Tintin. 
My friend Alexander Skantze, a writer who is very interested 
in comics and graphic novels, gave me the album Ghost 
world, which I really liked. I have also read Debbie 
Dreschler who has written/drawn very strong stories. However, 
Maus is overwhelming, in a different way. Especially 
the technique in Maus II, where Art Spiegelman not only tells 
us the story about his father's current heart-problems and his 
experiences of the concentration-camps in the past, he also tell 
us the story about himself writing the book and what problems 
the writing of it creates.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Yes, but it seems to me that you read many of the really 
important artists. To go back to your own work; your pictures 
are so wonderfully straggling and expressive. Did you have any 
role-model who inspired you when you started working with Miss 
Scardy-Cat?</SPAN>

<P>
-The way I graphically visualize strong feelings and their nuances 
- is the one thing I haven't thought about that much, that part 
of the process comes easy to me. Since it doesn't take that much 
effort I guess I haven't reflected much on that very part of 
my work.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-What I find most fascinating with your books is the way 
you visualize emotions. How did that develop?</SPAN>

<P>
-I often feel like a total stranger towards my own and other 
people's feelings and I guess that is why I find feelings so 
extremely interesting. It is a big challenge for me to try to 
understand, explain and dig deeply into these mysterious issues. 
It was also interesting when I realized that the books Anna Karin 
Cullberg and I made ten years ago are so very much like the books 
I do today.

<P>
<b>-OK, sometimes one shouldn't analyze good things to much. But 
Miss Scardy-Cat was a success, how many copies did it sell?</b>

<P>
-So far each book sold about 50.000 copies in Sweden. They've 
been translated into Norwegian, German and Finnish, but I don't 
know how many copies or editions there have been in each country. 
Albert Bonnier Publishers and I made an English translation and 
even if the chances are very small, I do hope that some English 
speaking country will be interested. I know that at least one 
American publisher is looking at the books right now.
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textit">(After this interview was published the book Miss 
Remarkable &amp; her Career was translated into English by Penguin 
books and into Japanese by Wani books Co.)</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Your books should be easy to launch in America since your 
format and your subjects agrees with the trends in the USA right 
now. What have the reactions on your books been? Is there <SPAN  CLASS="textit">anyone</SPAN></SPAN> 
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">who's been negative?</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN>-When Miss Scardy-Cat &amp; Love was published 
I had a lot of fine, rave reviews and one really bad review. 
That one hurt me a lot, but it was an important experience. Miss 
Remarkable &amp; her Career got a lot of overwhelming reviews 
- which of-course made me very happy - and I don't think anyone 
has been critical. It seems as if a lot of people understand 
what I want to achieve with this book.</SPAN>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Did you feel any performance anxiety after the success of 
your first book?</SPAN>

<P>
-Performance anxiety doesn't work that way with me. I would have 
felt it, if no one had thought me capable of anything, but I 
don't feel it from expectations. On the contrary, I like expectations.

<P>
-<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Then I guess I have to admit that I expect grand things 
from you in the future...(laugh). I like book number two better 
(Miss Remarkable &amp; her Career). It felt as if you were more 
thought-out, when it came to graphics. You seemed more relaxed 
with the form and how it worked.</SPAN>

<P>
-Yes, but Hello!...the first book was my first book, so everything 
was new to me. The format, to tell a story, the whole way of 
working. But I am glad you like the new one since I worked so 
much with it.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Yes, that was exactly what I meant, it is obvious that you 
learned a lot while creating the first book. The main character 
in the new book is quite similar to the main character in the 
first book, but am I right if I say they are not the same person? 
Why did you choose to change the main character?</SPAN>

<P>
-I thought a lot about different alternatives. For a while I 
even experimented with the idea of changing the main character's 
sex, but I gave up on that idea since I wanted to make a feminist 
statement. It isn't clear whether the main characters in the 
books are the same or not. Maybe it isn't important.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Why did you chose to make your second book about career?</SPAN>

<P>
-Career, work, performance anxiety and human value are issues 
that I have thought about for many years. When I worked with 
Miss Scardy-Cat &amp; Love I already knew that I 
wanted to do this other book. The obsession to become Someone 
by becoming something career-wise, the urge to be successful, 
our contempt for weakness... In Miss Scardy-Cat &amp; Love 
I made the choice of not bringing up the subject of career or 
work, at all. A person's job and career are so important in our 
society, that it isn't enough just to mention the subject in 
passing. If we get to know someone's profession then we immediately 
create such a strong picture of that person. Of course, that 
works the same way with made up characters. It would have been 
a different story if the reader was told that Miss Scardy-Cat, 
for example, was a sales-woman.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-No, I agree that we are obsessed with career in our society. 
That makes it difficult when people ask me what I am doing... 
I always ask them How long do you have? (laugh). 
In the book you mediate a rather negative picture of the ego-society 
where success is regarded as the same thing as happiness. Is 
it perhaps more Joanna's ideas, than her own life, that we can 
read out of the book?</SPAN>

<P>
-I'm not sure that I understand your question. However, you have 
to identify with the subject you write about, whatever it may 
be about. I think that the fact that I am a part of the very 
same society and have the same values that I am criticizing isn't 
a contradiction, rather a necessity.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-What I meant was that the main characters in your books 
obviously aren't copies of yourself, but one can probably understand 
a lot about who you are by reading your books. </SPAN>
<BR><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-I like the fact that you don't present an easy solution 
to the problems that the main character is struggling with. While 
reading your book I feared an obvious solution 
ending, inspired by New-Age or Managment-litterature.</SPAN>

<P>
-I worked for a long time with the ending. To find a balance 
in the end of the story was probably the most difficult part 
of the whole book. Both my books have the characteristics of 
developing novels. Hence, there is a huge risk that the endings 
turn out as messy smorgasbords of easy-peasy solutions to deep 
existential problems. As if the books were some kind of this-is-the-right-way-to-live-and-feel-and-think-and-do-keys.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Yes, that is something one has seen too many times already. 

<BR>
You were an illustrator initially, what kind of education do 
you have? </SPAN>

<P>
-I went to Nyckelvikskolan and to Konstfack (School of Fine Arts). 
To do illustrations or to tell a story in pictures are two very 
different ways of working. As I see it, it is almost two different 
jobs. When I do an illustration, I work with ideas, form, color 
and decoration. In my graphic novels the pictures have to work 
in a very different way. Since it would be far too expensive 
to use color, the pictures in my books are black and white. More 
importantly, the pictures must propel the story and blend with 
the words and the dialogue, the feelings and the atmosphere.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-When I wanted you to do a picture for the front-page of 
this issue of Bild&amp;bubbla you asked if you could 
do the whole front-page with the logotype and everything. I guess 
that you also design your own books?</SPAN>

<P>
-Yes, I do.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Then I must compliment you on having created two very good-looking 
books. They felt solid the minute I got them in my hand.</SPAN>

<P>
-Thanks. Since I sometimes design book covers for other writers, 
it seemed natural to do my own covers too.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Sure, the design and the cover of a book add a lot to the 
reading of the book, or at least that is how it works for me. 
Both your Miss-books had that plus. Your pictures 
are also on stamps now. That must have been an interesting experience.</SPAN>

<P>
-Yeah, that was real fun. When the Nobel Prize Stamps were released 
in Belgium I went to Brussels with the world-famous, ninety-year 
old engraver Cecslav Slania. We were guests at a huge Stamp Exhibition 
and there were crowds of people standing in winding lines to 
have their stamps signed by Cecslav. He was the king!

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-You started your career by doing children's books with your 
friend Anna-Karin Cullberg. How did that happen?</SPAN>

<P>
-Anna-Karin and I were in the same class in high school and we 
did a lot of schoolwork together, for example a paper about Existentialism. 
We really had fun doing it. After graduating from High School 
I went to Art School, Basis, and Anna-Karin started to work in 
a hospital. At the Art School I saw a poster about a Children's 
Books Competition. I talked to Anna-Karin about it and we decided 
to do something together. We got together in a pizza restaurant 
a couple of days before the deadline for the competition. In 
the pizzeria we wrote our first children's book, it only took 
a couple of hours. We called it Angry. The angriest book 
of the nineties.. We sent the manuscript and all the 
pictures, which we had made the same evening, by mail to the 
Publisher. We won the competition, which meant we got some prize 
money and that our book was published. That was so cool! It has 
never been that easy to write a book since.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-Will there be any more Miss books, or do 
you have other plans?</SPAN>

<P>
-There will absolutely be new books, but I don't know what 
kind of books they will be. Right now I am working with the illustrations 
for a children's book written by another writer. It is very enjoyable 
since I really love the story. I will definitely create new books 
of my own in the future. I have some ideas, but nothing I want 
to talk about right now...
